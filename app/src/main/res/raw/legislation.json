    "description / whitepaper": "Inclusive Prosperity Act of 2019\nIntroduced in Senate (05/22/2019)\n\n\n116th CONGRESS\n1st Session\nS. 1587\n\nTo impose a tax on certain trading transactions to invest in our families and communities, improve our infrastructure and our environment, strengthen our financial security, expand opportunity and reduce market volatility.\n\nIN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES\nMay 22, 2019\nMr. Sanders (for himself and Mrs. Gillibrand) introduced the following bill; which was read twice and referred to the Committee on Finance\n\nA BILL\nTo impose a tax on certain trading transactions to invest in our families and communities, improve our infrastructure and our environment, strengthen our financial security, expand opportunity and reduce market volatility.\n\nBe it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,\nSECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\nThis Act may be cited as the “Inclusive Prosperity Act of 2019”.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\nCongress finds the following:\n\n(1) The global financial crisis cost Americans $19 trillion in lost wealth.\n\n(2) The global financial crisis was caused by financial firms taking great financial risks without disclosing those risks to their investors or their regulators, and by regulatory failures to adequately police the financial services markets for crime, unfair or deceptive practices, fraud, lack of transparency, and mismanagement.\n\n(3) Deceptive, illegal, and speculative financial practices have harmed public confidence in the integrity and fairness of many United States financial institutions, and threaten the basic strengths of the United States economic system.\n\n(4) American citizens provided the money to stabilize the financial sector, making $700 billion available to 800 financial institutions, automakers, and insurance companies.\n\n(5) The global financial crisis, along with the wars, unabated and unaddressed climate change, unsustainable tax cuts, and a continuing unemployment crisis, if unaddressed, will deprive a generation of a meaningful role in the larger economy.\n\n(6) Nurses, teachers, public safety officers, and other public sector workers have faced drastic funding cuts, harming our long-term public safety and prospects for economic growth.\n\n(7) Extreme weather events rooted in climate change, including flood, drought, fire, super storms like Sandy, as well as “slow-onset” events like sea level rise, are wreaking havoc in the United States and across the globe resulting in climate change impacts that jeopardize the lives and livelihoods of Americans, causing large-scale food and energy insecurity in developing countries, and extolling untold economic costs.\n\n(8) According to economists, a small tax on transfer of ownership of every financial trade could generate hundreds of billions annually in revenue, which when invested could help create millions of good-paying jobs in both the public and private sectors every year, as well as provide urgently needed funding for programs to combat climate change and address global health and development issues.\n\n(9) A transactions tax will help limit high-frequency trading which may be as high as 70 percent of the market and results in declining market stability through extreme price volatility, distorted market prices, and structural vulnerability to speculation far in excess of the liquidity needs of commercial hedgers.\n\n(10) A securities transfer tax would have a negligible impact on the average investor.\n\n(11) The United States had a transfer tax from 1914 to 1966: The Revenue Act of 1914 (Act of Oct. 22, 1914 (ch. 331, 38 Stat. 745)) levied a 0.02 percent tax on all sales or transfers of stock which was doubled in 1932 to help overcome the budgetary challenges during the Great Depression.\n\n(12) Forty nations have or have had some form of a financial transactions tax; it is endorsed by more than 1,000 economists; and 10 European countries are moving forward on implementing a coordinated financial transactions tax after European Union finance ministers signaled approval in January 2013.\n\n(13) Revenue generated by this tax could be available to—\n\n(A) create a more dynamic economy and enhance economic opportunity by providing free college education and lessening student debt;\n\n(B) strengthen financial security and expand opportunity for low- and moderate-income families, including strengthening the social safety net and expanding resources for child care, Social Security, and savings incentives;\n\n(C) expand resources for State and Federal investments that protect our health and environment, investing in water and wastewater infrastructure, rebuild our crumbling physical infrastructure, and create good paying jobs by—\n\n(i) expanding and improving Medicare and Medicaid;\n\n(ii) investing in job training, public sector jobs, and green jobs;\n\n(iii) providing housing assistance to low-income households;\n\n(iv) investing in transportation including public mass transit and an infrastructure bank that promotes environmentally responsible domestic manufacturing and construction industries; and\n\n(v) protecting our environment and building a clean energy economy, including efforts to combat climate change and build resilience to its effects in the United States and in developing countries; and\n\n(D) fund international sustainable prosperity programs such as HIV treatment, research and prevention programs, other international health and humanitarian assistance, and climate change adaptation and mitigation efforts by developing countries.\n\nSEC. 3. TRANSACTION TAX.\n\n(a) In General.—Chapter 36 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended by inserting after subchapter B the following new subchapter:\n\n\n“Subchapter C—Tax On Trading Transactions\n\n“Sec. 4475.

    "description / whitepaper": "FOR THE 99.8% ACT\nSummary of Sen. Bernie Sanders’ legislation to tax the fortunes of the top 0.2%\nThe most important economic reality of our time is that over the past 40 years there has been an\nenormous transfer of wealth from the middle class to the wealthiest people in America.\nIn America today, the top one-tenth of one percent owns almost as much wealth as the bottom 90\npercent. The three wealthiest people in this country own more wealth than the bottom half of\nAmericans — 160 million people. Meanwhile, the median household in America has less\nwealth today than it did 35 years ago after adjusting for inflation, and the average wealth of those\nin the bottom 40 percent is virtually zero. While low-income workers at Walmart are forced\nto rely on food stamps, Medicaid and public housing to survive, the Walton family is now worth\nnearly $170 billion.\nMore than a century ago, Republican President Theodore Roosevelt fought for the creation of a\nprogressive estate tax to reduce the enormous concentration of wealth that existed during the\nGilded Age.\nAs Teddy Roosevelt said, \"The absence of effective state, and, especially, national restraint upon\nunfair money-getting has tended to create a small class of enormously wealthy and economically\npowerful men, whose chief object is to hold and increase their power. The prime need is to\nchange the conditions which enable these men to accumulate power … Therefore, I believe in a\n… graduated inheritance tax on big fortunes, properly safeguarded against evasion and\nincreasing rapidly in amount with the size of the estate.\"\nWhile Roosevelt spoke those words on August 31, 1910, they are even more relevant today.\nFrom a moral, economic, and political perspective our nation will not thrive when so few have so\nmuch and so many have so little. We need a tax system which asks the billionaire class to pay its\nfair share of taxes and which reduces the obscene level of wealth inequality in America.\nThe fairest way to reduce wealth inequality, invest in the disappearing middle class, and preserve\nour democracy is to enact a progressive estate tax on the inherited wealth of multi-millionaires\nand billionaires.\n\nThat is why Senator Sanders is introducing legislation to establish a progressive estate tax on the\nfortunes of the top 0.2 percent. Instead of an America for the wealthy and the powerful, we need\nto create an economy that works for the 99.8 percent.\nThis legislation:\n\n• Exempts the first $3.5 million of an individual’s estate from the estate tax.\nThis plan would only impact the wealthiest 0.2 percent of Americans who inherit more\nthan $3.5 million. 99.8 percent of Americans would not see their taxes go up by one\npenny under this plan.\n• Establishes a new progressive estate tax rate structure as follows:\no 45 percent on the value of an estate between $3.5 million and $10 million.\no 50 percent for the value of an estate between $10 million and $50 million.\no 55 percent for the value of an estate in excess of $50 million.\no 77 percent for the value of an estate in excess of $1 billion. (The top estate tax\nrate was 77 percent from 1941 to 1976, according to the Joint Committee on\nTaxation.)\n• Ends tax breaks for dynasty trusts. Billionaires like Sheldon Adelson and the Walton\nfamily, who own the majority of Walmart’s stock, have for decades manipulated the rules\nfor trusts to pass fortunes from one generation to the next without paying estate or gift\ntaxes. This bill would:\no Strengthen the “generation-skipping tax,” which is designed to prevent avoidance\nof estate and gift taxes, by applying it with no exclusion to any trust set up to last\nmore than 50 years.\no Prevent abuses of grantor retained annuity trusts (GRATs) by barring donors from\ntaking assets back from these trusts just a couple of years after establishing them\nto avoid gift taxes (while earnings on the assets are left to heirs tax-free). The\nlawyer who invented this technique for the Walton’s claims it has cost the\nTreasury $100 billion since 2000.\no Prevent wealthy families from avoiding gifts taxes by paying income taxes on\nearnings generated by assets in “grantor trusts.”\no Sharply limit the annual exclusion from the gift tax (which was meant to shield\nthe normal giving done around holidays and birthdays from tax and recordkeeping requirements) for gifts made to trusts.\n• Closes other loopholes in the estate and gift tax. One of these loopholes involves\n“valuation discounts,” restrictions placed on interests in family businesses which are\nclaimed, falsely, to reduce the value of the estate. Another loophole involves claiming\nthat the value of an inherited asset is lower, for estate tax purposes, than what is claimed\nfor income tax purposes to calculate gains when the asset is sold.\n• Protects farm land and conservation easements. The bill would protect family farmers\nby allowing them to lower the value of their farmland by up to $3 million for estate tax\npurposes. The bill also would increase the maximum exclusion for conservation\neasements to $2 million.\nUnder this legislation, the families of all 588 billionaires in America who have a combined\nnet worth of over $3 trillion would owe up to $2.2 trillion in estate taxes. See chart on page 4\nfor more information.\nSupport for Sanders’ Legislation\n“One century ago, the US invented steeply progressive estate and income taxes in order to\nmaintain the egalitarian and democratic legacy of the country. Today's US is becoming even\nmore unequal than Pre-World War I Europe. The way out is stronger investment in skills, higher\npaying jobs and a more progressive tax system. Sen. Sanders' estate tax bill, including a 77% tax\nrate on estate values above $1 billion, is an important step in this direction,” Thomas Piketty,\nthe top-selling author and Paris School of Economics professor.\n\"The estate tax was a key pillar of the progressive tax revolution that the United States ushered\none century ago. It prevented self-made wealth from turning into inherited wealth and helped\nmake America more equal. However, the estate tax is dying of neglect, as tax avoidance schemes\nare multiplying and left unchallenged. As wealth concentration is surging in the United States, it\nis high time to revive the estate tax, plug the loopholes, and make it more progressive. Senator\nSanders' bill is a bold and welcome leap forward in this direction,\" Emmanuel Saez, Professor\nof Economics at the University of California, Berkeley\n\"Even as the ranks of the working poor continue to grow, America is creating a new aristocracy\nof the non-working super rich with enormous influence over our economy and politics,\"\naccording to Robert B. Reich, a former U.S. Department of Labor secretary who is now a\nUniversity of California at Berkeley professor. Reich called Sanders' estate tax bill “an important\nstep toward reversing this trend.”\n“Progressive estate taxation is, along with progressive income and wealth taxation, one of the\nthree core components of a fair, meritocratic, and democratic tax system. Sen. Sanders’ bill is a\ncrucial step towards greater tax justice in America,” Gabriel Zucman, Professor of Economics\nat the University of California, Berkeley.\n“Senator Sanders’ estate tax bill is a big step in the right direction towards fulfilling the\nAmerican ideals of a more moral and decent economy and democracy. It would reverse the\niterative and intergenerational trend of consolidating our nation’s economic and political power\namongst the very elite, who are overwhelmingly white and underwhelmingly black,” Darrick\nHamilton, Professor of Economics and Urban Policy in the Milano School of Policy,\nManagement, and Environment, Schools of Public Engagement and the Department of\nEconomics, the New School for Social Research\n\"Senator Sander’s progressive estate tax bill is essential to protect our democracy and economy\nfrom the corrosive power of concentrated wealth. A century ago, President Theodore Roosevelt\nand industrialist Andrew Carnegie supported a steeply progressive estate tax to protect our\ndemocracy from plutocratic wealth and power. Senator Sanders has picked up this mantle in the\nsecond gilded age,\" Chuck Collins, Institute for Policy Studies coauthor, with Bill Gates Sr. of\nWealth and Our Commonwealth: Why America Should Tax Accumulated Fortunes",

    "description / whitepaper": "THE MEDICARE DRUG PRICE NEGOTIATION ACT OF 2019\nBACKGROUND\n• Prescription drug prices continue to skyrocket. Over the past decade, the prices of 90% of brand\nname drugs have more than doubled and prescription drug spending reached $333 billion in\n2017. In 2015, the average annual cost of therapy for widely used specialty drugs was about\n$53,000. This is more than twice the median income for people on Medicare and more than three\nand half times the average Social Security retirement benefit. A 2016 Commonwealth Fund\nsurvey found that nearly 20% of people reported not filling prescriptions because they could not\nafford them.\n• Medicare pays far more for drugs than government programs that negotiate. Under current\nlaw, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is prohibited from\nnegotiating lower drug prices on behalf of Medicare Part D beneficiaries. In contrast, other\ngovernment programs, like Medicaid and VA, are allowed to negotiate. As a result, Medicare\nPart D pays on average 73% more than Medicaid and 80% more than VA for brand name drugs.\nThe federal government could save between $15.2 and $16 billion a year if Medicare Part D paid\nthe same prices as Medicaid or VA.\n• High drug prices continue to stress the federal budget, particularly within Medicare.\nSince 2006, government programs have paid for approximately 40% of the retail prescription\ndrug expenditures in the United States. Medicare paid for 29% of retail drug costs in 2016. In\nlarge part as a result of skyrocketing drug prices, total spending on Medicare Part D is projected\nto more than double during the next 10 years, from $94.5 billion in 2018 to $195 billion in 2027.\n• Americans fully support negotiating authority for Medicare. According to a recent Kaiser\nFamily Foundation poll, 92% of Americans—including, Democrats, Republicans, and\nIndependents—want Medicare to negotiate for lower drug prices. According to the Center for\nEconomic and Policy Research, the U.S. government could save $976 billion over ten years if\nMedicare negotiated the same prices for drugs as people in Denmark pay.\n• President Trump claimed repeatedly that he supports negotiating lower drug prices.\nAfter being elected President, Donald Trump pledged: “I’m going to bring down drug prices.” He\nalso warned that the pharmaceutical industry is “getting away with murder.” He said Americans\ncould save billions of dollars if Medicare were allowed to negotiate directly with drug\ncompanies. “We don’t do it,” he said. “Why? Because of the drug companies.” He also said the\nU.S. must “create new bidding procedures for the drug industry.” He added: “Pharma has a lot of\nlobbies and a lot of lobbyists and a lot of power, and there’s very little bidding on drugs.” In\nMarch 2017, President Trump again criticized “outrageous” drug prices and pledged to create a\n“fair and competitive bidding process” that would result in prices “coming way, way, way\ndown.” In May 2018, President Trump promised yet again that, “We will have tougher\nnegotiation, more competition, and much lower prices at the pharmacy counter. And it will start\nto take effect very soon.” President Trump has openly acknowledged that “massive” spending\nand lobbying by the pharmaceutical industry has driven drug prices, “through the roof.” \nTHE MEDICARE DRUG PRICE NEGOTIATION ACT OF 2019\nSUMMARY OF LEGISLATION\nAllowing Medicare to Negotiate Lower Drug Prices\n• Under current law, the Secretary of HHS is prohibited from negotiating lower drug prices on\nbehalf of Medicare Part D beneficiaries. This is called the “non-interference clause.”\n• The bill would strike the non-interference clause and direct the Secretary to negotiate lower\nprices with drug manufacturers that participate in Medicare Part D.\n• The bill would direct the Secretary to prioritize negotiating for drugs that place the most\nburden on seniors and taxpayers: high-cost drugs, drugs that have significant price increases,\ndrugs that drive up Medicare Part D spending, and drugs without competition.\n• The bill would provide for automatic renegotiation of drug prices every three years.\n• The bill would direct the Secretary to further leverage the purchasing power of the\ngovernment by using drug formularies to enhance competition.\n• The bill would allow Part D plans to use additional benefit design and formulary tools to\nsecure steeper discounts or rebates for beneficiaries.\n• The bill would establish fallback prices based on what other federal agencies and five foreign\ncountries – Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, and Japan – pay. These fallback\nprices would kick in automatically if negotiations with drug manufacturers are unsuccessful.\n• The bill would preserve critical protections for patient access by including in any formulary\ncertain categories and classes of drugs that are protected under current law and by\nstrengthening the patient appeals processes for Part D plans.\nRestoring Low-Income Beneficiary Rebates\n• The bill would restore required drug rebates for low-income beneficiaries that were lost when\nMedicare Part D was created in 2006.\n• CBO has projected that restoring these rebates for brand-name drugs alone would save\ntaxpayers $154 billion over ten years.\n• Before Part D came into effect, people who were eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid\nreceived their drug benefits through Medicaid. After Part D was created, these people began\nreceiving their drug benefits through Medicare.\n• Drug manufacturers that participate in Medicaid are required to provide discounts in the form\nof rebates back to Medicaid, but there are no similar statutory rebates for Medicare.\n• As a result of shifting the drug benefits for these dual-eligible individuals from Medicaid to\nMedicare, the pharmaceutical industry received a huge windfall of billions of dollars in\nrebates drug companies were no longer required to pay.",

    "description / whitepaper": "THE STOP BAD EMPLOYERS BY ZEROING OUT SUBSIDIES (BEZOS) ACT\nIn America today, far too many large, profitable corporations pay their employees poverty\nwages causing workers to rely on government assistance programs like Medicaid, food stamps\nand public housing to make ends meet. All of these programs are paid for by the American\ntaxpayer. In fact, low wages cost taxpayers $152.8 billion per year, according to a 2015 study\nfrom the University of California, Berkeley Labor Center.\nHere are just a few examples:\n• Walmart pays its associates wages so low that many of them are forced to rely on food\nstamps, Medicaid and public housing to survive at a cost to U.S. taxpayers of an\nestimated $6.2 billion a year.\n• Low wages at McDonald's alone cost the federal government and U.S. taxpayers over\n$1.2 billion a year, while 52 percent of all fast food workers rely upon public assistance\nprograms to survive.\n• According to The New Food Economy, 1 out of 3 Amazon workers in Arizona and 2,400\nin Pennsylvania and Ohio depend on food stamps to put food on the table.\n• According to a recent survey, some 27 percent of workers at American Airlines\nsubsidiary Envoy Air make wages so low that they rely on food stamps and other forms\nof public assistance to survive.\nThe fact is if employers in this country simply paid workers a living wage, taxpayers would save\nabout $150 billion a year on federal assistance programs. Large companies, not taxpayers,\nshould be required to pay for federal public assistance programs that their employees are eligible\nto receive.\nThat is why on Wednesday, September 5th, Sen. Sanders will introduce the Stop Bad Employers\nby Zeroing Out Subsidies (BEZOS) Act. This bill would establish a corporate welfare tax on\nlarge employers equal to the amount of federal benefits received by their low-wage workers. For\nexample, if a worker at a large employer receives $300 in food stamps, the employer would be\ntaxed $300.\nUnder this legislation, large employers are defined as employers who have more than 500\nemployees, including part-time workers, independent contractors and franchise workers. Federal\nbenefits are defined as: the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), Medicaid, the\nschool lunch program and Section 8 housing. Additionally, the bill makes it unlawful for a large\nemployer to ask employees whether or not they qualify for federal benefits. Finally, the IRS, in\nconsultation with USDA, HUD and CMS will issue regulations necessary to administer the\ncorporate welfare tax.\nThe Stop Bezos Act gives large employers a choice: pay workers a living wage or pay for the\npublic assistance programs low-wage workers are forced to rely upon.",
