As Americans, they deserve just as much coverage from federal health programs as everyone else and to have their voices heard in Washington.\\nHowever, compared to the fifty states and the District of Columbia, the Medicaid and Medicare programs provide significantly less federal assistance to residents of the U.S. territories. While the federal government provides Medicaid funding to states on an open-ended basis, and matches state spending based on need, it caps the total annual health care funding for the territories and matches funds at an artificially low level, capped by statute. Furthermore, under current law, low-income Medicare beneficiaries residing in the territories are ineligible to receive Part D subsidies for their prescription drugs. Hospital payments do not adequately reflect the number of low-income patients treated or uncompensated care provided.

SHORT TITLE.\n\nThis Act may be cited as the “Inclusive Prosperity Act of 2019”.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\nCongress finds the following:\n\n(1) The global financial crisis cost Americans $19 trillion in lost wealth.\n\n(2) The global financial crisis was caused by financial firms taking great financial risks without disclosing those risks to their investors or their regulators, and by regulatory failures to adequately police the financial services markets for crime, unfair or deceptive practices, fraud, lack of transparency, and mismanagement.\n\n(3) Deceptive, illegal, and speculative financial practices have harmed public confidence in the integrity and fairness of many United States financial institutions, and threaten the basic strengths of the United States economic system.\n\n(4) American citizens provided the money to stabilize the financial sector, making $700 billion available to 800 financial institutions, automakers, and insurance companies.\n\n(5) The global financial crisis, along with the wars, unabated and unaddressed climate change, unsustainable tax cuts, and a continuing unemployment crisis, if unaddressed, will deprive a generation of a meaningful role in the larger economy.\n\n(6) Nurses, teachers, public safety officers, and other public sector workers have faced drastic funding cuts, harming our long-term public safety and prospects for economic growth.\n\n(7) Extreme weather events rooted in climate change, including flood, drought, fire, super storms like Sandy, as well as “slow-onset” events like sea level rise, are wreaking havoc in the United States and across the globe resulting in climate change impacts that jeopardize the lives and livelihoods of Americans, causing large-scale food and energy insecurity in developing countries, and extolling untold economic costs.\n\n(8) According to economists, a small tax on transfer of ownership of every financial trade could generate hundreds of billions annually in revenue, which when invested could help create millions of good-paying jobs in both the public and private sectors every year, as well as provide urgently needed funding for programs to combat climate change and address global health and development issues.\n\n(9) A transactions tax will help limit high-frequency trading which may be as high as 70 percent of the market and results in declining market stability through extreme price volatility, distorted market prices, and structural vulnerability to speculation far in excess of the liquidity needs of commercial hedgers.\n\n(10) A securities transfer tax would have a negligible impact on the average investor.\n\n(11) The United States had a transfer tax from 1914 to 1966: The Revenue Act of 1914 (Act of Oct. 22, 1914 (ch. 331, 38 Stat. 745)) levied a 0.02 percent tax on all sales or transfers of stock which was doubled in 1932 to help overcome the budgetary challenges during the Great Depression.\n\n(12) Forty nations have or have had some form of a financial transactions tax; it is endorsed by more than 1,000 economists; and 10 European countries are moving forward on implementing a coordinated financial transactions tax after European Union finance ministers signaled approval in January 2013.\n\n(13) Revenue generated by this tax could be available to—\n\n(A) create a more dynamic economy and enhance economic opportunity by providing free college education and lessening student debt;\n\n(B) strengthen financial security and expand opportunity for low- and moderate-income families, including strengthening the social safety net and expanding resources for child care, Social Security, and savings incentives;\n\n(C) expand resources for State and Federal investments that protect our health and environment, investing in water and wastewater infrastructure, rebuild our crumbling physical infrastructure, and create good paying jobs by—\n\n(i) expanding and improving Medicare and Medicaid;\n\n(ii) investing in job training, public sector jobs, and green jobs;\n\n(iii) providing housing assistance to low-income households;\n\n(iv) investing in transportation including public mass transit and an infrastructure bank that promotes environmentally responsible domestic manufacturing and construction industries; and\n\n(v) protecting our environment and building a clean energy economy, including efforts to combat climate change and build resilience to its effects in the United States and in developing countries; and\n\n(D) fund international sustainable prosperity programs such as HIV treatment, research and prevention programs, other international health and humanitarian assistance, and climate change adaptation and mitigation efforts by developing countries.\n\nSEC. 3.

While the top 1 percent owns more wealth than the bottom 92 percent, the typical middle class family in America has seen their net worth go down by 30 percent from 2007 to 2016. It is time for Wall Street to pay society back for the incredible damage it did – and continues to do – to the middle class of this country.\\n"

and\r\n\r\n(C) impose on any executive, including the chief executive officer (or equivalent) who led the finance, research, marketing, or sales department of the corporate entity during the calendar year in which a court enters a judgment that the corporate entity violated subsection (b) and who is not subject to a civil penalty under subparagraph (A) or (B), a civil penalty in the amount equal to the sum of—\r\n\r\n(i) 25 percent of the salary of the individual from the corporate entity during the calendar year in which a court enters such judgment;

          "pText": "WASHINGTON, May 21 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) led a bicameral group of lawmakers in introducing the Opioid Crisis Accountability and Results Act, as Vermont Attorney General T. J. Donovan announced a lawsuit today against former Purdue Pharma CEO Richard Sackler and seven family members who served on Purdue’s Board of Directors for deliberately misrepresenting the risks of the drug OxyContin.\\nThe Opioid Crisis Accountability and Results Act, introduced with Sen. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.) and Representatives Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) and Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii), prohibits illegal marketing and distribution of opioids; creates criminal liability for top company executives; penalizes drug manufacturers who illegally advertise, market or distribute an opioid product; and requires drug makers to reimburse the country for the negative economic impact of their products.\\nThe opioid epidemic is estimated to cost the United States over $78 billion per year. In 2016 alone, over 42,000 people died from opioid overdoses. From 1999 to 2016, the number of opioid overdose deaths more than tripled, and U.S. life expectancy as a whole fell for the third year in a row in 2017, due in part to the increase in opioid-related deaths.\\n“We know that pharmaceutical companies lied about the addictive impacts of opioids they manufactured. They knew how dangerous these products were, but refused to tell doctors and patients. While some of these companies have made billions each year in profits, not one of them has been held fully accountable for its role in an epidemic that is killing tens of thousands of Americans every year,” Sanders said. “At a time when local, state and federal governments are spending many billions of dollars a year dealing with the impact of the opioid epidemic, we must hold the pharmaceutical companies and executives that created the crisis accountable.”\\n“Communities across the country are being ripped apart by the opioid epidemic. Multi-billion-dollar pharmaceutical companies and their executives reaped large profits for years while their questionable marketing and distribution practices precipitated a devastating public health crisis,” Bennet said. “It is far past time for Congress to ensure opioid manufacturers, distributors, and executives fund our response to the crisis they created. Our bill will support programs that combat the opioid crisis and ensure we hold companies and their executives accountable for any future misconduct.”\\n“When I visit the communities that have been ravaged by the opioid epidemic, I see the victims of unscrupulous pharmaceutical companies that have put profits over the patients they were intended to serve,” said Khanna. “This bill holds opioid manufacturers and their executives accountable for decades of dishonest sales practices and malicious drug distribution. Over the past 20 years, more than 400,000 people have died of opioid overdoses, and millions more have been stricken by addiction. Their loved ones deserve justice.”\\n“Opioid companies have lied, cheated, and profited from the addiction and death left in the wake of the crisis they helped create. The criminal nature of these companies’ actions have destroyed families as well as strained the criminal justice and public health systems,” said Rep. Tulsi Gabbard. “This bill would create tools to hold companies and executives accountable for preying on patients using deceptive marketing tactics, as they proliferated these highly-addictive and destructive drugs on our streets.”\\nAny company found in violation of the Opioid Crisis Accountability and Results Act would be fined 25 percent of the profits from their opioid products. Drug manufacturers who illegally advertise, market or distribute an opioid product would also be stripped of any remaining period of market exclusivity for that opioid product, and would lose half of the remaining exclusivity period on other opioid products they have on the market. The legislation would also fine any company found liable for contributing to the opioid epidemic $7.8 billion—10 percent of the annual cost of the opioid crisis.\\nOrganizations endorsing the legislation include Public Citizen, CREDO, American Medical Student Association (AMSA), National Collaborative for Health Equity and Prescription Justice."

The Loan Shark Prevention Act would give this same authority to the Federal Reserve to raise the 15% interest rate cap on credit cards.\\nThe reasonable interest rate cap Congress imposed on credit unions has protected consumers from being charged usurious interest rates; it has not harmed the safety and soundness of these institutions; and it has not negatively impacted the access to credit of credit union members.\\nCredit union members with good credit scores are still able to receive credit cards and loans that they need at reasonable interest rates. And, unlike banks, credit unions have not received hundreds of billions of dollars from U.S. taxpayers from the Treasury Department of the Federal Reserve.

          "pText": "“How are you going to pay for it?”\\nThat is the question that bookends nearly every media conversation that takes place on Medicare for All. The straightforward answer is, we already are.\\nUnlike other government outlays – for example, a ship for the Navy – Medicare for All does not represent any new spending at all. Instead, it represents a rebalance of how our current dollars are spent.\\nIf Congress were to authorize the Navy to procure an aircraft carrier, and appropriate the necessary funding, the federal government would spend approximately $13 billion building that ship. If Congress does not authorize and appropriate the funding, then the ship will not get built. People will not individually purchase an aircraft carrier, nor will any private corporation.\\nHealth care is fundamentally different. If the status quo stays in place, between 2022 and 2031 the federal government will spend $59.65 trillion. According to estimates from the conservative Mercatus Center, under the Senate’s Medicare for All legislation, those expenditures will drop by approximately $2 trillion.2\\nAnother study released by PERI at the University of Massachusetts found that “Medicare for All could reduce total health care spending in the U.S. by nearly 10 percent,” resulting in more than $5 trillion in savings.\\nToday, the traditional Medicare program only spends 2 percent of its costs on administration. That’s less than one-sixth the administrative costs of private health insurance companies.\\nStudies have found that the U.S. could save up $500 billion annually in billing and administrative costs by moving to Medicare for All. That money could be used to greatly expand primary care in this country and make certain that all Americans get the health care they needed when they need it – saving billions on expensive emergency room care and hospital visits.\\nMoreover, the United States pays, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs – because Congress has done nothing to regulate the price of medicine. If the U.S. joined the rest of the industrialized world and negotiated with the pharmaceutical companies to lower prices, our country could save up to $113 billion per year.\\nA Medicare for All system not only benefits individuals and families, it would benefit the business community. Small- and medium-sized businesses would be free to focus on their core business goals instead of wasting precious energy and resources navigating an incredibly complex system to provide health insurance to their employees.\\nUnder the current system, while thousands of Americans die each year because they lack access to the health care they desperately need, the top five health insurance companies in 2018 made $21 billion in profits, led by the UnitedHealth Group, which made $11.99 billion.\\nAs tens of thousands of American families face bankruptcy and financial ruin because of the outrageously high cost of health care, the top 65 healthcare CEOs made $1.7 billion in compensation in 2017 including $83.2 million for the CEO of UnitedHealth Group; $58.7 million for the CEO of Aetna; and $43.9 million for the CEO of Cigna.\\nThere is broad consensus – from conservative to progressive economists – that the Senate Medicare for All bill, as written, would result in substantial savings to the American people.\\nThe question is what entity is fundamentally responsible for financing our nation’s health?\\nMedicare for All represents a belief that our current system relies far too heavily on individuals’ ability to finance necessary and lifesaving medical care through premiums, co-pays, deductibles, and other out-of-pocket expenses. Under a Medicare for All system, government would be the chief financier of health care.\\nThe largest share of national health expenditures already comes from the government, amounting to $26 trillion out of the $47 trillion, or 55 percent, of what our country will spend on health care from 2018 to 2027.\\nHousehold, business, and philanthropic spending makes up the rest, with $20.7 trillion in projected spending from 2018 to 2027. It should be noted that for expensive medical illnesses and procedures, private philanthropy has become a major source of funding, and not just from the wealthy and foundations.\\nGoFundMe has reported that one in three of the site’s campaigns are to pay for medical bills. The site hosts more than 250,000 of these campaigns, raising more than $650 million each year. In November 2018, Spectrum health rejected a candidate for a heart transplant because it did not believe she could afford the regimen of immunosuppressive drugs required after surgery. The rejection letter recommended “a fundraising effort of $10,000.”\\nThis gets to the heart of why the rebalancing of the chart above is necessary. Fundamentally, our dysfunctional system not only puts health care out of financial reach for millions of Americans who cannot afford necessary drugs such as insulin, it is regressive in its individual financial impact.\\nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, health care – and health insurance, specifically – account for a much higher share of spending for those toward the bottom of the income distribution than those at the top. Lower income groups also spend a greater portion of their income on costs not covered by insurance. Medicare for All solves the fundamental moral question of making sure those at the bottom are no longer locked out of the health care system due to cost. Our financing system must fundamentally correct this flaw in our current system.\\nAs the wealthiest country in the world, we have a variety of options available to support a Medicare for All, single-payer health care system that guarantees high quality, affordable health care as a right, not a privilege, to every man, woman, and child in this country.\\nThose options include, but are not limited to:\\n"

Under every single one of these options the average American family will save thousands of dollars a year because it will no longer be writing large checks to private health insurance companies.\\nA study by RAND found that moving to a Medicare-for-all system in New York would save a family with an income of $185,000 or less about $3,000 a year, on average. Citizens for Tax Justice found that middle class families would see their after-tax income go up by about $3,240 a year under Medicare for All. Another study found that middle class families would spend about 14 percent less of their income on health care than they do today. Even the projections from the Mercatus Center suggest that the average American could save about $6,000 under Medicare for all over a 10-year period.\\nToday, the United States has the most expensive, inefficient, and bureaucratic health care system in the world. Despite the fact that we are the only major country on Earth not to guarantee health care for all -- and have 34 million Americans who are uninsured and even more who are underinsured -- we now spend more than twice as much per capita on health care as the average developed country.\\nAccording to a recent study, 45 percent of Americans are worried a major illness could leave them bankrupt, 1 out of 4 Americans skipped needed medical care because they could not afford it, and 77 percent are concerned rising health costs will cause significant and lasting damage to our economy.\\nAccording to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, we spend more than $10,700 per capita on health care. Meanwhile, Canada spends just $4,826, France spends $4,902, Germany spends $5,728, and the United Kingdom spends $4,264 per person on health care.\\nFurther, despite the fact that health care spending consumes almost 18 percent of our GDP, our health care outcomes are worse than all of these other countries. For example, our life expectancy is 2.5 years lower than Germany's and our mortality rate for children under the age of 18 is at the top of the list compared to other developed countries.\\nIn other words, every major industrialized nation on earth has made health care a right, provided universal coverage to all, and achieved far better health outcomes in terms of life expectancy and infant mortality rates – all while spending far less per capita than we do. Please do not tell us that 5 the United States of America, the wealthiest nation in the history of the world, cannot do the same.\\nThere needs to be vigorous debate as to the best way to finance our Medicare for All legislation. Unlike the Republican leadership in Congress which held no hearings on their disastrous bill which would have thrown 32 million people off of health insurance, we will continue to get the best ideas from economists, doctors, nurses, and ordinary Americans to guarantee health care as a fundamental right."

    "description / whitepaper": "FOR THE 99.8% ACT\nSummary of Sen. Bernie Sanders’ legislation to tax the fortunes of the top 0.2%\nThe most important economic reality of our time is that over the past 40 years there has been an\nenormous transfer of wealth from the middle class to the wealthiest people in America.\nIn America today, the top one-tenth of one percent owns almost as much wealth as the bottom 90\npercent. The three wealthiest people in this country own more wealth than the bottom half of\nAmericans — 160 million people. Meanwhile, the median household in America has less\nwealth today than it did 35 years ago after adjusting for inflation, and the average wealth of those\nin the bottom 40 percent is virtually zero. While low-income workers at Walmart are forced\nto rely on food stamps, Medicaid and public housing to survive, the Walton family is now worth\nnearly $170 billion.\nMore than a century ago, Republican President Theodore Roosevelt fought for the creation of a\nprogressive estate tax to reduce the enormous concentration of wealth that existed during the\nGilded Age.\nAs Teddy Roosevelt said, The absence of effective state, and, especially, national restraint upon\nunfair money-getting has tended to create a small class of enormously wealthy and economically\npowerful men, whose chief object is to hold and increase their power. The prime need is to\nchange the conditions which enable these men to accumulate power … Therefore, I believe in a\n… graduated inheritance tax on big fortunes, properly safeguarded against evasion and\nincreasing rapidly in amount with the size of the estate.\nWhile Roosevelt spoke those words on August 31, 1910, they are even more relevant today.\nFrom a moral, economic, and political perspective our nation will not thrive when so few have so\nmuch and so many have so little. We need a tax system which asks the billionaire class to pay its\nfair share of taxes and which reduces the obscene level of wealth inequality in America.\nThe fairest way to reduce wealth inequality, invest in the disappearing middle class, and preserve\nour democracy is to enact a progressive estate tax on the inherited wealth of multi-millionaires\nand billionaires.\n\nThat is why Senator Sanders is introducing legislation to establish a progressive estate tax on the\nfortunes of the top 0.2 percent. Instead of an America for the wealthy and the powerful, we need\nto create an economy that works for the 99.8 percent.\nThis legislation:\n\n• Exempts the first $3.5 million of an individual’s estate from the estate tax.\nThis plan would only impact the wealthiest 0.2 percent of Americans who inherit more\nthan $3.5 million. 99.8 percent of Americans would not see their taxes go up by one\npenny under this plan.\n• Establishes a new progressive estate tax rate structure as follows:\no 45 percent on the value of an estate between $3.5 million and $10 million.\no 50 percent for the value of an estate between $10 million and $50 million.\no 55 percent for the value of an estate in excess of $50 million.\no 77 percent for the value of an estate in excess of $1 billion. (The top estate tax\nrate was 77 percent from 1941 to 1976, according to the Joint Committee on\nTaxation.)\n• Ends tax breaks for dynasty trusts. Billionaires like Sheldon Adelson and the Walton\nfamily, who own the majority of Walmart’s stock, have for decades manipulated the rules\nfor trusts to pass fortunes from one generation to the next without paying estate or gift\ntaxes. This bill would:\no Strengthen the “generation-skipping tax,” which is designed to prevent avoidance\nof estate and gift taxes, by applying it with no exclusion to any trust set up to last\nmore than 50 years.\no Prevent abuses of grantor retained annuity trusts (GRATs) by barring donors from\ntaking assets back from these trusts just a couple of years after establishing them\nto avoid gift taxes (while earnings on the assets are left to heirs tax-free). The\nlawyer who invented this technique for the Walton’s claims it has cost the\nTreasury $100 billion since 2000.\no Prevent wealthy families from avoiding gifts taxes by paying income taxes on\nearnings generated by assets in “grantor trusts.”\no Sharply limit the annual exclusion from the gift tax (which was meant to shield\nthe normal giving done around holidays and birthdays from tax and recordkeeping requirements) for gifts made to trusts.\n• Closes other loopholes in the estate and gift tax. One of these loopholes involves\n“valuation discounts,” restrictions placed on interests in family businesses which are\nclaimed, falsely, to reduce the value of the estate. Another loophole involves claiming\nthat the value of an inherited asset is lower, for estate tax purposes, than what is claimed\nfor income tax purposes to calculate gains when the asset is sold.\n• Protects farm land and conservation easements. The bill would protect family farmers\nby allowing them to lower the value of their farmland by up to $3 million for estate tax\npurposes. The bill also would increase the maximum exclusion for conservation\neasements to $2 million.\nUnder this legislation, the families of all 588 billionaires in America who have a combined\nnet worth of over $3 trillion would owe up to $2.2 trillion in estate taxes. See chart on page 4\nfor more information.\nSupport for Sanders’ Legislation\n“One century ago, the US invented steeply progressive estate and income taxes in order to\nmaintain the egalitarian and democratic legacy of the country. Today's US is becoming even\nmore unequal than Pre-World War I Europe. The way out is stronger investment in skills, higher\npaying jobs and a more progressive tax system. Sen. Sanders' estate tax bill, including a 77% tax\nrate on estate values above $1 billion, is an important step in this direction,” Thomas Piketty,\nthe top-selling author and Paris School of Economics professor.\nThe estate tax was a key pillar of the progressive tax revolution that the United States ushered\none century ago. It prevented self-made wealth from turning into inherited wealth and helped\nmake America more equal. However, the estate tax is dying of neglect, as tax avoidance schemes\nare multiplying and left unchallenged. As wealth concentration is surging in the United States, it\nis high time to revive the estate tax, plug the loopholes, and make it more progressive. Senator\nSanders' bill is a bold and welcome leap forward in this direction, Emmanuel Saez, Professor\nof Economics at the University of California, Berkeley\nEven as the ranks of the working poor continue to grow, America is creating a new aristocracy\nof the non-working super rich with enormous influence over our economy and politics,\naccording to Robert B. Reich, a former U.S. Department of Labor secretary who is now a\nUniversity of California at Berkeley professor. Reich called Sanders' estate tax bill “an important\nstep toward reversing this trend.”\n“Progressive estate taxation is, along with progressive income and wealth taxation, one of the\nthree core components of a fair, meritocratic, and democratic tax system. Sen. Sanders’ bill is a\ncrucial step towards greater tax justice in America,” Gabriel Zucman, Professor of Economics\nat the University of California, Berkeley.\n“Senator Sanders’ estate tax bill is a big step in the right direction towards fulfilling the\nAmerican ideals of a more moral and decent economy and democracy. It would reverse the\niterative and intergenerational trend of consolidating our nation’s economic and political power\namongst the very elite, who are overwhelmingly white and underwhelmingly black,” Darrick\nHamilton, Professor of Economics and Urban Policy in the Milano School of Policy,\nManagement, and Environment, Schools of Public Engagement and the Department of\nEconomics, the New School for Social Research\nSenator Sander’s progressive estate tax bill is essential to protect our democracy and economy\nfrom the corrosive power of concentrated wealth. A century ago, President Theodore Roosevelt\nand industrialist Andrew Carnegie supported a steeply progressive estate tax to protect our\ndemocracy from plutocratic wealth and power. Senator Sanders has picked up this mantle in the\nsecond gilded age, Chuck Collins, Institute for Policy Studies coauthor, with Bill Gates Sr. of\nWealth and Our Commonwealth: Why America Should Tax Accumulated Fortunes",

          "pText": "The most important economic reality of our time is that over the past 40 years there has been an enormous transfer of wealth from the middle class to the wealthiest people in America.\\nIn America today, the top one-tenth of one percent owns almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent. The three wealthiest people in this country own more wealth than the bottom half of Americans — 160 million people. Meanwhile, the median household in America has less wealth today than it did 35 years ago after adjusting for inflation, and the average wealth of those in the bottom 40 percent is virtually zero. While low-income workers at Walmart are forced to rely on food stamps, Medicaid and public housing to survive, the Walton family is now worth nearly $170 billion.\\nMore than a century ago, Republican President Theodore Roosevelt fought for the creation of a progressive estate tax to reduce the enormous concentration of wealth that existed during the Gilded Age.\\nAs Teddy Roosevelt said, \\The absence of effective state, and, especially, national restraint upon unfair money-getting has tended to create a small class of enormously wealthy and economically powerful men, whose chief object is to hold and increase their power. The prime need is to change the conditions which enable these men to accumulate power … Therefore, I believe in a … graduated inheritance tax on big fortunes, properly safeguarded against evasion and increasing rapidly in amount with the size of the estate.\\\\nWhile Roosevelt spoke those words on August 31, 1910, they are even more relevant today.\\nFrom a moral, economic, and political perspective our nation will not thrive when so few have so much and so many have so little. We need a tax system which asks the billionaire class to pay its fair share of taxes and which reduces the obscene level of wealth inequality in America.\\nThe fairest way to reduce wealth inequality, invest in the disappearing middle class, and preserve our democracy is to enact a progressive estate tax on the inherited wealth of multi-millionaires and billionaires.\\nThat is why Senator Sanders is introducing legislation to establish a progressive estate tax on the fortunes of the top 0.2 percent. Instead of an America for the wealthy and the powerful, we need to create an economy that works for the 99.8 percent."

    "description / whitepaper": "THE MEDICARE DRUG PRICE NEGOTIATION ACT OF 2019\nBACKGROUND\n• Prescription drug prices continue to skyrocket. Over the past decade, the prices of 90% of brand\nname drugs have more than doubled and prescription drug spending reached $333 billion in\n2017. In 2015, the average annual cost of therapy for widely used specialty drugs was about\n$53,000. This is more than twice the median income for people on Medicare and more than three\nand half times the average Social Security retirement benefit. A 2016 Commonwealth Fund\nsurvey found that nearly 20% of people reported not filling prescriptions because they could not\nafford them.\n• Medicare pays far more for drugs than government programs that negotiate. Under current\nlaw, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is prohibited from\nnegotiating lower drug prices on behalf of Medicare Part D beneficiaries. In contrast, other\ngovernment programs, like Medicaid and VA, are allowed to negotiate. As a result, Medicare\nPart D pays on average 73% more than Medicaid and 80% more than VA for brand name drugs.\nThe federal government could save between $15.2 and $16 billion a year if Medicare Part D paid\nthe same prices as Medicaid or VA.\n• High drug prices continue to stress the federal budget, particularly within Medicare.\nSince 2006, government programs have paid for approximately 40% of the retail prescription\ndrug expenditures in the United States. Medicare paid for 29% of retail drug costs in 2016. In\nlarge part as a result of skyrocketing drug prices, total spending on Medicare Part D is projected\nto more than double during the next 10 years, from $94.5 billion in 2018 to $195 billion in 2027.\n• Americans fully support negotiating authority for Medicare. According to a recent Kaiser\nFamily Foundation poll, 92% of Americans—including, Democrats, Republicans, and\nIndependents—want Medicare to negotiate for lower drug prices. According to the Center for\nEconomic and Policy Research, the U.S. government could save $976 billion over ten years if\nMedicare negotiated the same prices for drugs as people in Denmark pay.\n• President Trump claimed repeatedly that he supports negotiating lower drug prices.\nAfter being elected President, Donald Trump pledged: “I’m going to bring down drug prices.” He\nalso warned that the pharmaceutical industry is “getting away with murder.” He said Americans\ncould save billions of dollars if Medicare were allowed to negotiate directly with drug\ncompanies. “We don’t do it,” he said. “Why? Because of the drug companies.” He also said the\nU.S. must “create new bidding procedures for the drug industry.” He added: “Pharma has a lot of\nlobbies and a lot of lobbyists and a lot of power, and there’s very little bidding on drugs.” In\nMarch 2017, President Trump again criticized “outrageous” drug prices and pledged to create a\n“fair and competitive bidding process” that would result in prices “coming way, way, way\ndown.” In May 2018, President Trump promised yet again that, “We will have tougher\nnegotiation, more competition, and much lower prices at the pharmacy counter. And it will start\nto take effect very soon.” President Trump has openly acknowledged that “massive” spending\nand lobbying by the pharmaceutical industry has driven drug prices, “through the roof.” \nTHE MEDICARE DRUG PRICE NEGOTIATION ACT OF 2019\nSUMMARY OF LEGISLATION\nAllowing Medicare to Negotiate Lower Drug Prices\n• Under current law, the Secretary of HHS is prohibited from negotiating lower drug prices on\nbehalf of Medicare Part D beneficiaries. This is called the “non-interference clause.”\n• The bill would strike the non-interference clause and direct the Secretary to negotiate lower\nprices with drug manufacturers that participate in Medicare Part D.\n• The bill would direct the Secretary to prioritize negotiating for drugs that place the most\nburden on seniors and taxpayers: high-cost drugs, drugs that have significant price increases,\ndrugs that drive up Medicare Part D spending, and drugs without competition.\n• The bill would provide for automatic renegotiation of drug prices every three years.\n• The bill would direct the Secretary to further leverage the purchasing power of the\ngovernment by using drug formularies to enhance competition.\n• The bill would allow Part D plans to use additional benefit design and formulary tools to\nsecure steeper discounts or rebates for beneficiaries.\n• The bill would establish fallback prices based on what other federal agencies and five foreign\ncountries – Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, and Japan – pay. These fallback\nprices would kick in automatically if negotiations with drug manufacturers are unsuccessful.\n• The bill would preserve critical protections for patient access by including in any formulary\ncertain categories and classes of drugs that are protected under current law and by\nstrengthening the patient appeals processes for Part D plans.\nRestoring Low-Income Beneficiary Rebates\n• The bill would restore required drug rebates for low-income beneficiaries that were lost when\nMedicare Part D was created in 2006.\n• CBO has projected that restoring these rebates for brand-name drugs alone would save\ntaxpayers $154 billion over ten years.\n• Before Part D came into effect, people who were eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid\nreceived their drug benefits through Medicaid. After Part D was created, these people began\nreceiving their drug benefits through Medicare.\n• Drug manufacturers that participate in Medicaid are required to provide discounts in the form\nof rebates back to Medicaid, but there are no similar statutory rebates for Medicare.\n• As a result of shifting the drug benefits for these dual-eligible individuals from Medicaid to\nMedicare, the pharmaceutical industry received a huge windfall of billions of dollars in\nrebates drug companies were no longer required to pay.",

After two years, the Secretary would have the authority to permit importation from countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) that meet specified statutory or regulatory standards that are comparable to U.S. standards.\\nThe bill would not permit importation of controlled substances, anesthetic drugs inhaled during surgery, or compounded drugs. Legally imported drugs under this Act must be purchased from an FDA-certified foreign seller and have the same active ingredient(s), route of administration, and strength as drugs approved in the U.S. Certain types of drugs, such as certain biologics, could only be imported by wholesalers or pharmacies.\\nIn order to be a “certified foreign seller,” the entity must be a wholesale distributor or licensed foreign pharmacy, be current with any applicable registration fees, and sell only qualifying prescription drugs. Certification criteria include that the establishment: (1) is located in Canada; (2) is engaged in the distribution of prescription drugs offered for importation under this bill; (3) has been in existence for at least five years and has a purpose for existing other than for this program; (4) if selling to an individual, does so only after receiving a valid prescription; (5) can certify that the physical premises and data reporting procedures and licenses are in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations in Canada, and has implemented policies to monitor compliance; (6) conducts ongoing and comprehensive quality assurance programs, including blind testing; (7) agrees that laboratories approved by the Secretary shall be used to test product samples; (8) agrees to notify the Secretary, importers, and individuals of product recalls; (9) has a process for resolving grievances and will be held accountable for violations of established rules; (10) does not sell products to customers in the United States that the seller could not otherwise legally sell in Canada; (11) meets any other criteria established by the Secretary. The bill would require recertification every two years or until there is a material change in circumstances.\\nCertified foreign sellers shall pay a fee, as determined by the Secretary, to fund the administration and enforcement of the program.\\nAdditionally, the bill specifies that individuals importing a prescription drug under this Act shall do so only from pharmacies licensed to practice pharmacy and dispense drugs in Canada, shall purchase only for personal use in quantities that do not exceed a 90-day supply, and must have a valid prescription issued by a health care practitioner licensed to practice in the U.S.\\nImporters under this bill are required to submit biannual reports to the Secretary containing information on the drugs they are purchasing from certified foreign sellers, including the name, strength and dosage form, number of containers and container size, lot number, date of the transaction and shipment, business names and addresses of seller and purchaser, and the unique facility identifier where the drug was manufactured.\\nThe bill grants the Secretary authority to approve one or more laboratories to conduct random testing of prescription drugs to assess their chemical authenticity.\\nThe bill grants the Secretary authority to suspend the importation of a product or suspend all products from a certified foreign seller or importer if there is an importation involving counterfeit drugs, drugs that have been recalled or withdrawn, or drugs in violation of any requirement of this section until an investigation is completed and the Secretary determines that the drug, seller, or importer does not endanger the public health. The Secretary must suspend a product or all products from a seller or importer if there is a pattern of such violations.\\nExcept in the case of a drug shortage, the bill prohibits drug manufacturers from directly or indirectly engaging in actions to restrict, prohibit, or delay the importation of qualifying drugs under this program.\\nUnder this bill, persons selling adulterated or counterfeit products with the intent to defraud or mislead, with reckless disregard for safety of the public, or knowingly dispensing drugs without a valid prescription, shall face a penalty of not more than 10 years imprisonment or a fine of not more than $250,000.\\nThe bill clarifies that nothing under this Act preempts or changes remedies available under state, federal, or common law for civil relief.\\nCertified foreign sellers may only purchase drugs intended for importation into the U.S. from FDA-registered manufacturers and entities or other certified foreign sellers, and shall provide to the importer information including the unique facility identifier associated with the manufacturer, the transaction history, transaction information (including the name of the product, the strength and dosage form, the container size, the number of containers, the lot number, the date of the transaction, the date of the shipment, and the business names and addresses of the entities selling and receiving the drug), and a statement that the certified foreign seller did not knowingly ship a suspect or illegitimate product, provide false transaction information or alter the transaction history of the drug. The Secretary shall seek to enter into a memorandum of understanding (MOU) or cooperative agreement with Canada or another permitted country to ensure compliance with Subchapter H of chapter V of the FDCA (track and trace); such MOU or cooperative agreement may supersede these requirements.\\nThe Secretary of Health and Human Services shall issue a report to Congress and the public not later than one year after the date the rules are final. GAO shall also conduct a study within 18 months following the final rule to analyze the implementation of the Act, including a review of drug safety and cost-savings and expenses, including cost-savings to consumers in the United States and trans-shipment and importation tracing processes.\\n"

According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, 8 percent of American adults – 19 million people – say they or someone in their household had imported a drug at some point to get a lower price.\\nSafety standards regulated by Health Canada and the European Union are as tough as FDA standards, according to a December 2016 bipartisan report from the Senate Special Committee on Aging: “While some countries’ pharmaceutical manufacturing standards are lax, others, particularly in Canada and the European Union, are stringent and comparable to U.S. standards.”\\nCanadian officials say U.S. drug prices are so high that they are skewing the cost of those medicines in Canada. Drug prices in Canada are informed by prices in seven other countries, including the United States. Canada’s Minister of Health Jane Philpott recently said she wants to strike the U.S. from that list and replace it with a country like New Zealand, where drug prices are much lower.\\nAllowing the importation of safe and affordable prescription drugs is overwhelmingly supported by the American people.

Unfortunately, instead of using its profits to  raise their low wages, Walmart plans to buy back $20 billion of its own stock over a two-year period to enrich its executives and shareholders.\\nThe Walton family is Walmart’s largest shareholder, owning about 50 percent of its stock. It is also the wealthiest family in the country with a net worth of around $180 billion. Since 1982, the wealth of the Walton family has increased about 10,000 percent. This one family owns more wealth than the bottom 40 percent of Americans. Meanwhile, 55 percent of Walmart’s associates are food insecure.\\nIf Walmart can afford $20 billion for stock buybacks to enrich the likes of the Waltons, it can afford to raise the pay of its workers to a living wage. It would cost Walmart $3.8 billion a year to raise its minimum wage to $15 an hour and would benefit nearly 1 million workers. Even though Walmart claims it cannot afford to pay its workers $15 an hour, it was able to find enough money to pay its CEO more than $22 million last year – or almost $11,000 an hour. If Walmart can pay its CEO $11,000 an hour, it can afford to increase the wages of its workers to a living wage."

          "pText": "Emergency Legislation to Help Struggling Dairy Farmers\\nVermont’s dairy farmers are struggling to survive. The price they get for their milk has been below the cost of production for four years in a row. Since 2014, dairy prices have fallen from $25 per hundredweight to less than $16. That’s less than farmers received in 1989.\\nNot surprisingly, Vermont has already lost more than 65 dairy farms this year alone and about one-third of its dairy farms in the last decade. Today, there are just 709 active dairy farms left in Vermont.\\n“This is a crisis,” Sanders said. “Hard-working farmers are losing their livelihoods, their homes and their way of life. And, as farms disappear, so do the businesses and jobs they support. And so does Vermont’s iconic working landscape, as dairy farming still accounts for 80 percent of all farmland in our state.”\\n“The loss of farms is a harbinger for declining rural viability, and it’s happening all across rural America,” Sanders said. “We can’t let that happen.”\\nSanders’ bill gives priority for emergency payments to farmers that live in states where the cost of milk production is higher than the national average, and to farmers with smaller operations. Both of these measures will benefit Vermont’s family farmers.\\nIn 2009, Sanders successfully secured $350 million in emergency funding to support dairy farmers throughout the U.S. That legislation meant an average of $8,000 in emergency federal support for a Vermont dairy farmer with a 125-cow herd.\\n“Farmers clearly need our help now. This is a matter of survival,” Sanders said. “However, while this bill will provide temporary relief, ultimately we need a sustainable, long-term solution to ensure farmers receive a fair price for the high-quality milk they produce. To my mind, that has got to include managing the supply of milk. We must also take a hard look at consolidation in dairy processing and distribution, and whether we need stronger antitrust laws to protect consumers and producers alike.”\\nSanders also sent a letter to U.S. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue on Thursday to urge the agency to use its authority to purchase dairy products to be distributed to food shelters nationally.\\n“Right now, we have a situation where our dairy farmers are struggling to survive because of extremely low milk prices. We are producing too much milk and far too many Americans – including millions of children – go to bed hungry because they do not have enough to eat,” Sanders said. “I urge Secretary Perdue to use the authority he already has to purchase and distribute dairy products through the Emergency Food Assistance Program. This will help farmers, as well as millions of Americans who struggle to put food on the table.”\\nSanders’ office has organized a series of listening sessions with Vermont dairy farmers to get their input on how to improve milk prices and the long-term viability of dairy farming. The first discussion will be held this Friday in Middlebury, Vermont. "

    "description / whitepaper": "THE STOP BAD EMPLOYERS BY ZEROING OUT SUBSIDIES (BEZOS) ACT\nIn America today, far too many large, profitable corporations pay their employees poverty\nwages causing workers to rely on government assistance programs like Medicaid, food stamps\nand public housing to make ends meet. All of these programs are paid for by the American\ntaxpayer. In fact, low wages cost taxpayers $152.8 billion per year, according to a 2015 study\nfrom the University of California, Berkeley Labor Center.\nHere are just a few examples:\n• Walmart pays its associates wages so low that many of them are forced to rely on food\nstamps, Medicaid and public housing to survive at a cost to U.S. taxpayers of an\nestimated $6.2 billion a year.\n• Low wages at McDonald's alone cost the federal government and U.S. taxpayers over\n$1.2 billion a year, while 52 percent of all fast food workers rely upon public assistance\nprograms to survive.\n• According to The New Food Economy, 1 out of 3 Amazon workers in Arizona and 2,400\nin Pennsylvania and Ohio depend on food stamps to put food on the table.\n• According to a recent survey, some 27 percent of workers at American Airlines\nsubsidiary Envoy Air make wages so low that they rely on food stamps and other forms\nof public assistance to survive.\nThe fact is if employers in this country simply paid workers a living wage, taxpayers would save\nabout $150 billion a year on federal assistance programs. Large companies, not taxpayers,\nshould be required to pay for federal public assistance programs that their employees are eligible\nto receive.\nThat is why on Wednesday, September 5th, Sen. Sanders will introduce the Stop Bad Employers\nby Zeroing Out Subsidies (BEZOS) Act. This bill would establish a corporate welfare tax on\nlarge employers equal to the amount of federal benefits received by their low-wage workers. For\nexample, if a worker at a large employer receives $300 in food stamps, the employer would be\ntaxed $300.\nUnder this legislation, large employers are defined as employers who have more than 500\nemployees, including part-time workers, independent contractors and franchise workers. Federal\nbenefits are defined as: the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), Medicaid, the\nschool lunch program and Section 8 housing. Additionally, the bill makes it unlawful for a large\nemployer to ask employees whether or not they qualify for federal benefits. Finally, the IRS, in\nconsultation with USDA, HUD and CMS will issue regulations necessary to administer the\ncorporate welfare tax.\nThe Stop Bezos Act gives large employers a choice: pay workers a living wage or pay for the\npublic assistance programs low-wage workers are forced to rely upon.",

But what’s even worse is nearly a quarter of all people incarcerated on any given day in the U.S. are “unconvicted”—meaning they are sitting in jail waiting for a trial, or plea bargain, or some sort of conclusion to their case.\\nStudy after study has shown the average American could not come up with $400 in an emergency, and people in prison tend to start out poorer than most Americans, with average earnings of less than $20,000 annually prior to incarceration. If you are making that little, chances are you do not have a spare $1,000 set aside in case of emergency, and you will have no choice but to sit in jail awaiting your trial—or more likely, your plea deal.\\nPretrial detention is bad for society and bad for our criminal justice system. People held pretrial are missing days of work. They are missing time with their families. Often enough, they run the risk of missing a rent payment and losing their housing. Studies have shown people are more likely to take a plea bargain just to end their pretrial detention that much sooner.\\nMeanwhile, the U.S. spends nearly $14 billion each year locking people up without a conviction. It’s clear the system is a poor use of resources—in 2015, the city of New Orleans collected $4.5 million in bail, fines, and fees, but spent $6.4 million detaining people who couldn’t afford to pay their bail, fine, or fee. And as with so many other aspects of our society, for-profit companies are making a fortune off poor defendants. The for-profit bail industry makes between $1.4 and $2.4 billion each year—the United States is one of only two countries in the world that even allows for-profit bond companies.\\nIt has always been clear that we have separate criminal justice systems in this country for the poor and for the rich. A wealthy person charged with a serious crime may get an ankle monitor and told not to leave the country; a poor person charged with a misdemeanor may sit in a jail cell. And this disproportionately affects minorities—fifty percent of all pretrial detainees are Black or Latinx.\\nPretrial detention should be based on whether or not someone truly should not be freed before their trial. It should not depend on how much money they have, or what kind of mood the judge is in on a given day, or even what judge the case happens to come before. We also must insure that jurisdictions do not eliminate cash bail but find pretexts to continue unfairly locking people up before trial."

Since 1970, the Social Security Administration’s (SSA) funding has gone down 34 percent per beneficiary, adjusting for inflation. In 2017, SSA was asked to support over 70 million Americans with 1.3 percent in administrative funding.

This has resulted in the loss of more than 10,000 employees, the closure of all rural contact centers, and over 10 percent of all field offices nationwide. And these funding cuts have had an unconscionable human cost—last year alone, 10,000 people died and thousands more lost their homes or declared bankruptcy while waiting on a disability decision.\\nThe Social Security Administration Fairness Act will give SSA the funding it needs to provide services that Americans have paid for and certainly deserve. This legislation will restore timely service to beneficiaries, address the one million person disability backlog, speed up the time it takes for seniors and persons with disabilities to receive Social Security and Medicare benefits, and prevent the SSA from closing field offices that provide essential services to the American people.\\nSocial Security is a lifeline for many seniors and individuals with disabilities.

This input is especially critical given the potential for non-operational plants to sit for decades before removal and decontamination. This legislation would transform a process that is weighted almost entirely toward the power plant licensees into one that strikes a reasonable balance between licensees and the impacted communities.\\nWelch, who is introducing companion legislation in the House, said, “Vermonters are well aware that decommissioning a nuclear power plant has an enormous economic and environmental impact on states and neighboring communities. It is essential that state and local leaders have a seat at the table throughout the decommissioning process. This commonsense legislation ensures the decommissioning process is transparent, inclusive and collaborative so that all interested parties are heard.”\\nThe Vermont Yankee nuclear power plant in Vernon was shuttered at the end of 2014 and the current owner has proposed selling the plant. This bill would give affected states like Vermont an opportunity to weigh in on the new shut down plan in the instance of a license transfer.\\n"

          "pText": "Nobody here would deny the importance of fostering and rewarding innovation in medicines, but we have got to find a way to do it that eliminates indefensible pricing barriers that lead to health care rationing, unnecessary suffering and premature death.\\nMy bill would eliminate market exclusivity for new drugs and instead offer cash rewards from a \\Medical Innovation Prize Fund\\ for new products that improve health outcomes. By eliminating monopolies and allowing generic competition as soon as a new drug enters the market, prices on drugs would fall dramatically, saving taxpayers, employers and consumers more than $200 billion per year, a savings far greater than the $80 billion prize fund that would be financed through public and private insurers savings.\\nAn example of how American consumers pay dramatically more under the current system is an HIV/AIDS drug called Atripla. A prescription in the United States costs more than $24,000 per patient per year, yet the U.S. government buys the FDA-approved generic version for programs in developing countries for only $192 per person per year.  Another example is the AIDS antiviral drug Tenofovir. The average retail price in the United States is $908.21 per month. The same drug sells for $5.40 for a month's supply in South Africa.\\nUnder my plan, patent holders no longer would be given monopoly rights to control the manufacturing and sale of products. Instead, patents would serve as a claim on eligibility for the cash rewards given for new inventions. Drugs developed without patents also would be eligible for the prizes.\\nThe measure effectively would put an end to deceptive marketing practices that exaggerate benefits and understate harmful side effects. It also would reduce waste by drug companies that spend huge sums developing copycat drugs that are of little medical value.\\nBy making prescription drugs more affordable, the measure would help reduce the number of Americans who die every year in the United States because they lack health insurance. The number now stands at 45,000, a 2009 Harvard study calculated.\\n Today, more than 50 million Americans have no health insurance. Another 29 million are underinsured, often lacking drug coverage. The health reform law Congress passed two years ago will extend coverage to 31 million uninsured Americans but still will leave 23 million with no health insurance.\\n"
